Paul and the team did exactly this. As an example, he would coordinate site meetings with himself, the underfloor heating engineer and heating engineer. This ensured complete cohesion with everyone connected with the work.

I would say, if anyone needs a Huddersfield building firm that delivers outstanding results, on time with a quality of workmanship. Demonstrates outstanding knowledge Codus is the firm to use. I now consider Codus as the only builders in Huddersfield I will use. No more searching for a company that you can trust..”</p>

“I have been working with Codus Construction for some time on the renovation of a large Grade II listed building which needed significant modernisation.

The works have included underfloor heating, structural work, restoration of the roof, reconfiguring rooms, new bathrooms, insulation throughout, flooring, kitchen, windows and roof lights. Due to the nature of the building and often difficult phasing of the work it has been imperative to work with a company who have committed to providing a certain level of quality in terms of workmanship and delivery.

The works at my home will continue for some time and I am delighted working with Codus Construction to complete the project.”” </p>
